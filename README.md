Aeron Quick
=====

This is simply a library that wraps the [official Aeron project](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron) to allow anyone to integrate more easily with 
the high performance messaging system called "Aeron".

The goal is to provide a simple API that doesn't need boilerplate code to have aeron working with default settings while
still allowing users to customize and adapt as their performance requirements grow.
